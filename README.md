# AERUM â€“ Artificially Emulated Remote Unit Missioncrew

AERUM is an onboard AI crew system designed to autonomously operate satellites through role-based LLM agents.

## Core Features
- Role-specific AI agents (Mission Lead, Orbital Engineer, etc.)
- Autonomous spacecraft operation (simulated & hardware-capable)
- Natural language interface for mission control
- Modular architecture for extension (robotic arms, payloads, etc.)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run a sample mission: `python src/main.py --mission debris_removal`
